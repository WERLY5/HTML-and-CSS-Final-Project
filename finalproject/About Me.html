                    <p>I am a free-spirited 25-year-old living in Northern Michigan and a father to my 4-year-old daughter named Adalyn. I graduated highschool in 2013 and I currently go to College full-time, taking my Associates in General Studies, as well as my Certificate of Achievement in Digital Admin and Marketing.</p>

                    <p>On top of going to school I also have a full-time job working for a food service store who I’ve been with for a year. Traveling is a passion of mine. Exploring new destinations has always brought excitement to me. The world is so big and unfortunately I’ve only visited so little of it.</p>

                    <p>Another passion of mine that I have recently discovered is veganism and living a plant-based life. I have been vegetarian for 1.2 years and a full vegan for almost 3 months as of this writing.<br>
                    I have connected a webpage I created on veganism to this site. You can find the link in the navigation menu.</p>
